Rock, Paper, Scissors(, Magic), written for the Spring 2023 CSCI 4300 - Operating Systems final project

I wrote this last spring for a final project. It's not great, or particularly well organized or written, but there's a good few concepts demonstrated here: networking, threads, and custom artwork assets, to name a few. Working within the limits of the standard library was also a fun challenge.

I've removed all personally identifying information and put it in a public repo for posterity.

I got a decent grade, but lost a pretty substantial amount of points simply due to the fact that I A) wasn't supposed to put client and server in the same script, and B) was supposed to give the server script a GUI. Whoops. (Everything else got a pretty glowing review, though, which I'm very very proud of!)

So if you're doing the same project I did and you're here to plagiarize my code, don't. You're better off doing the project yourself if you want to avoid making the same dumb mistakes.

Also, you're not going to fool the professor anyway. They literally have a doctorate.
